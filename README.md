The "Autonomous Driving Scenario Reconstruction Dataset Compression" project is implemented on HDMapNet and Lift, Splat, Shoot. 
The datasets used are NuScenes V1.0-mini and the full version of NuScenes V1.0. 
Specifically, HDMapNet implements data pruning based on loss, while Lift, Splat, Shoot employs both PPO-based data pruning and loss-based data pruning.
